This is quite a long program and shows the length of listing required to achieve a degree of realism. The game uses all of page 0800 and portions of 0900, 0A00, 0B00 and 0D00. The main program is at 0800 with calls at the other pages. The game consists of unusual shaped aliens passing across the display. Each game consists of 16 passes and you must shoot down the arrivals by pressing buttons 1, 2 or 3. To win, you must shoot down at least 11. In the initial stages of the game, you must acquaint yourself with the connection betweeen the spiroid shapes and buttons 1, 2, 3. After this you will be ready to launch an attack.
